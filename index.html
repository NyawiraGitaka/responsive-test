        Experts do agree that the croissant was inspired by the Austrian kipfel, a crescent-shaped baked good featuring a
        generous amount of butter or lard and sometimes sugar and almonds. According to popular lore, the kipfel originated in
        1683 as a comestible celebration of Austrian victory over the Ottomans at the siege of Vienna. The story follows that a
        baker, up early to make bread, saved the city when he heard the Turks tunneling underneath the city and sounded an
        alarm. The kipfel’s curved shape, said to mimic the crescent moon of the Ottoman flag, then would seem to pay poetic
        tribute to the indomitable spirit of a city that resisted a powerful invading force. (Conveniently, another legend holds
        that the cappuccino was invented almost simultaneously, inspired by the strong Turkish coffee gained in the spoils of
        war.)
